# Stoat
Stoat (STochastic model App Tester) is a guided approach to perform stochastic model-based testing on Android Apps. The idea is to thoroughly test the functionalities of an app from its GUI model, and validate the appâ€™s behavior by enforcing various user/system interactions.

# Setup 

You can checkout Stoat from this repo.

### Environment Configration
* Ruby: 2.2 

* [Nokogiri](http://www.nokogiri.org/tutorials/installing_nokogiri.html)

* Python: 2.7

* Android SDK: API 18/19

* Ubuntu 14.04/Linux

* uiautomator (A python wrapper of [UIAutomator](https://github.com/xiaocong/uiautomator))

We strongly recommend to run Stoat on a physical machine to ensure the performance instead of ruuning on virtual machines (e.g., VirtualBox or Docker). In addition, please choose x86 image if you use Android emulators, and [setup hardware acceleration](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-acceleration.html) for [Ubuntu](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/KVM/Installation).

Please export ANDROID_HOME (for android sdk), PYTHON_PATH (for uiautomator), CLASSPATH (for soot)

 Example:
  ```
  export ANDROID_HOME="/home/XX/Android/Sdk"
  export PYTHONPATH="/home/XX/uiautomator"
  export CLASSPATH="/home/XX/fsmdroid/soot-github/lib/soot-develop.jar
  export PATH=$PATH:${ANDROID_HOME}/build-tools/25.0.0:${ANDROID_HOME}/tools:${ANDROID_HOME}/platform-tools:
  ```
  
# Usage

Stoat provides several ways to test android apps by command lines. Note before running Stoat, please disable keyboard (for emulator, add "hw.keyboard=yes" in its config.ini; for real device, please install the "com.wparam.nullkeyboard_1.apk" at "fsmdroid/bin", and configure it to be the default input method)

1. Ant opens-soruce projects

 	ruby run_stoat_testing.rb --app_dir /home/XX/caldwell.ben.bites_4_src --avd_name testAVD_1 --avd_port 5554 --stoat_port 2000 --project_type ant 
 	
2. apk without instrumentation

	Note this may mitigate Stoat's power due to lack of coverage info for test optimization. Otherwise, you need to instrument apk with Ella
    
	ruby run_stoat_testing.rb --app_dir /home/XX/Bites.apk --avd_name testAVD_1 --avd_port 5554 --stoat_port 2000 (the output will be under "/home/XX/Bites-output")
 	 
3. Use real device, ant projects

	Please open wifi, and disable keyboard before do testing on real device.
    
 	ruby run_stoat_testing.rb --app_dir /home/XX/caldwell.ben.bites_4_src/ --real_device_serial cf00b9e6 --stoat_port 2000 --project_type ant 
	
4. A list of apps

	ruby run_stoat_testing.rb --apps_dir /home/XX/test_apps/ --apps_list /home/XX/test_apps/apps_list.txt --avd_name testAVD_1 --avd_port 5554 --stoat_port 2000 --force_restart


### Subject Requirement:
* instrumented apps (use [Emma](http://emma.sourceforge.net/index.html) for open-source apps and [Ella](https://github.com/saswatanand/ella) for closed-source apps) should end with "-debug.apk"
* closed-source/non-instrumented apk can also be tested, and its name should end with ".apk"

##  Notes
* This implementation has been tested with Android 4.4, running on Ubuntu 14.04. 
* If measure statement coverage for open-sourced apps, the subjects need to be processed to support EMMA/JaCoCo instrumentation:
(Please refer to [Dynodroid](https://code.google.com/archive/p/dyno-droid/) for details.)
