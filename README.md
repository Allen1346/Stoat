# Stoat
Stoat (STochastic model App Tester) is a guided approach to perform stochastic model-based testing on Android Apps. The idea is to thoroughly test the functionalities of an app from its GUI model, and validate the appâ€™s behavior by enforcing various user/system interactions.

# Setup 

You can checkout Stoat from this repo.

### Environment Configration
* Ruby: 2.2

* Python: 2.7

* Android SDK: API 18/19

* Ubuntu 14.04/Linux 

We strongly recommend to run Stoat on a physical machine to ensure the performance instead of ruuning on virtual machines (e.g., VirtualBox or Docker). In addition, please choose x86 image if you use Android emulators, and [setup hardware acceleration](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-acceleration.html) for [Ubuntu](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/KVM/Installation).

# Usage

Stoat provides several ways to test android apps by command lines.

### Subject Requirement:
* instrumented apps (use [Emma](http://emma.sourceforge.net/index.html)/[Jacoco](http://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/trunk/index.html) for open-source apps and [Ella](https://github.com/saswatanand/ella) for closed-source apps) should end with "-debug.apk"
* closed-source/non-instrumented apk can also be tested, and its name should end with ".apk" 

##  Notes
* This implementation has been tested with Android 4.4, running on Ubuntu 14.04 and Mac OS 10.10
* If measure statement coverage for open-sourced apps, the subjects need to be processed to support EMMA instrumentation:
